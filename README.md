Introduction
The Spotify Music Recommendation System is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance the music listening experience for users of the Spotify platform. Utilizing a blend of content-based filtering and popularity weighting, this system provides personalized song recommendations that align with users' musical preferences while also emphasizing the latest and most popular tracks.

Key Features
Content-Based Recommendations:
The system uses musical features of tracks to find and recommend songs that are similar to a user's chosen song.
It leverages a dataset of Spotify tracks, analyzing attributes like danceability, energy, and genre.
Popularity-Based Weighting:
Beyond just content similarity, the system assigns weights to songs based on their release dates.
Recent songs receive higher weights, ensuring that the recommendations stay fresh and relevant.
Hybrid Recommendation Approach:
The core of this system is the hybrid recommendation function, which merges content-based suggestions with popularity scores.
This approach balances the similarity of musical features with the trendiness and recentness of songs.
User Interaction:
Users input a song name, and the system returns a curated list of recommendations.
The system ensures that the input song is not included in the recommendations, providing new musical discoveries.
Data Handling and Analysis:
The system uses the Spotipy library to interact with the Spotify API, fetching detailed track data.
Pandas is employed for data manipulation and analysis, creating a seamless workflow for handling large music datasets.
